Implementation for Continual Federated Learning

This project implements a replay memory based continual federated algorithm. This work demonstrates the proposed CFLAG algorithm (currently under peer review) is effective towards mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning under data-privacy preserving federated setup.
